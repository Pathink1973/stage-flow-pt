  # Optimize All RLS Policies with Auth Initialization Pattern

  ## Overview
  Optimizes ALL RLS policies by using (select auth.uid()) instead of auth.uid().
  This prevents re-evaluation of auth functions for each row, significantly improving 
  query performance at scale.

  ## Performance Impact
  - Reduces auth function calls from O(n) to O(1) per query
  - Improves query planning and execution time
  - Better performance with large datasets
  - Recommended by Supabase best practices

  ## Changes
  Drops and recreates all existing policies with the optimized pattern:
  - auth.uid() â†’ (select auth.uid())
  
  Affected tables:
  1. profiles (3 policies)
  2. rooms (4 policies)
  3. room_members (4 policies)
  4. cues (4 policies)
  5. timers (4 policies)
  6. messages (4 policies)
  7. qa_submissions (3 policies)
  8. device_sessions (3 policies)
  9. timer_color_settings (3 policies)

  ## Important Notes
  - All policies maintain exact same logic, only optimization added
  - No security changes, only performance improvements
  - Uses SELECT to initialize auth context once per query
